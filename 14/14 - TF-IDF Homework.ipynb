       "[\"mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time . \\nmy good colleague from california raised the exact and critical point . \\nthe question is , what happens during those 45 days ? \\nwe will need to support elections . \\nthere is not a single member of this house who has not supported some form of general election , a special election , to replace the members at some point . \\nbut during that 45 days , what happens ? \\nthe chair of the constitution subcommittee says this is what happens : martial law . \\nwe do not know who would fill the vacancy of the presidency , but we do know that the succession act most likely suggests it would be an unelected person . \\nthe sponsors of the bill before us today insist , and i think rightfully so , on the importance of elections . \\nbut to then say that during a 45-day period we would have none of the checks and balances so fundamental to our constitution , none of the separation of powers , and that the presidency would be filled by an unelected member of the cabinet who not a single member of this country , not a single citizen , voted to fill that position , and that that person would have no checks and balances from congress for a period of 45 days i find extraordinary . \\ni find it inconsistent . \\ni find it illogical , and , frankly , i find it dangerous . \\nthe gentleman from wisconsin refused earlier to yield time , but i was going to ask him , if virginia has those elections in a shorter time period , they should be commended for that . \\nso now we have a situation in the congress where the virginia delegation has sent their members here , but many other states do not have members here . \\ndo they at that point elect a speaker of the house in the absence of other members ? \\nand then three more states elect their representatives , temporary replacements , or full replacements at that point . \\nthey come in . \\ndo they elect a new speaker ? \\nand if that happens , who becomes the president under the succession act ? \\nthis bill does not address that question . \\nthis bill responds to real threats with fantasies . \\nit responds with the fantasy , first of all , that a lot of people will still survive ; but we have no guarantee of that . \\nit responds with the fantasy that those who do survive will do the right thing . \\nwe are here having this debate , we have debates every day , because people differ on what the right thing is to do . \\ni have been in very traumatic situations with people in severe car wrecks and mountain climbing accidents . \\nmy experience has not been that crisis imbues universal sagacity and fairness . \\nit has not been that . \\npeople respond in extraordinary ways , and we must preserve an institution that has the deliberative body and the checks and balances to meet those challenges . \\nmany of our states are going increasingly to mail-in ballots . \\nwe in this body were effectively disabled by an anthrax attack not long after september 11 . \\ni would ask my dear friends , will you conduct this election in 45 days if there is anthrax in the mail and still preserve the franchise of the american people ? \\nhow will you do that ? \\nyou have no answer to that question . \\ni find it extraordinary , frankly , that while saying you do not want to amend the constitution , we began this very congress by amending the constitution through the rule , by undermining the principle that a quorum is 50 percent of the body and instead saying it is however many people survive . \\nand if that rule applies , who will designate it , who will implement it ? \\nthe speaker , or the speaker 's designee ? \\nagain , not an elected person , as you say is so critical and i believe is critical , but a temporary appointee , frankly , who not a single other member of this body knows who they are . \\nso we not only have an unelected person , we have an unknown person who will convene this body , and who , by the way , could conceivably convene it for their own election to then become the president of the united states under the succession act . \\nyou have refused steadfastly to debate this real issue broadly . \\nyou had a mock debate in the committee on the judiciary in which the distinguished chairman presented my bill without allowing me the courtesy or dignity to defend it myself . \\nand on that , you proudly say you defend democracy . \\nsir , i think you dissemble in that regard . \\nhere is the fundamental question for us , my friends , and it is this : the american people are watching television and an announcement comes on and says the congress has been destroyed in a nuclear attack , the president and vice president are killed and the supreme court is dead and thousands of our citizens in this town are . \\nwhat happens next ? \\nunder your bill , 45 days of chaos . \\napparently , according to the committee on the judiciary subcommittee on the constitution chairman , 45 days of marshal law , rule of this country by an unelected president with no checks and balances . \\nor an alternative , an alternative which says quite simply that the people have entrusted the representatives they send here to make profound decisions , war , taxation , a host of other things , and those representatives would have the power under the bill of the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 bill or mine to designate temporary successors , temporary , only until we can have a real election . \\nthe american people , in one scenario , are told we do not know who is going to run the country , we have no representatives ; where in another you will have temporary representatives carrying your interests to this great body while we deliberate and have real elections . \\nthat is the choice . \\nyou are making the wrong choice today if you think you have solved this problem . \\n\",\n",
       " \"mr. chairman , i want to thank my good friend from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 . \\ni will always remember that day , as we all will . \\nhis point is well taken . \\ni understand there is good intent behind the bill before us today and the amendment , but it is not enough . \\nit simply is not . \\nit leaves our country vulnerable for 45 days and that is too long . \\nthe distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary made some comments recently that suggested that somehow terrorists would oppose this bill and by some implication would favor the bill the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 and i have put forward because it seems to support their autocratic views of government . \\nnothing could be further from the truth . \\nin fact , what our bill would do is tell the terrorists , you could come on a single day and set off a nuclear weapon in this town and kill every single member of us ; and though we would be missed , the very next day the congress would be up and functioning with every single state , every single district having full representation by statesmen and stateswomen at a time of national crisis . \\nthat is what the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 and i are trying to do . \\nwe are trying to tell the terrorists , you can kill all of us as individuals , but you will not defeat this institution . \\nyou will not defeat the principle of representation . \\nyou will not defeat the principles of checks and balances . \\nyou will not impose martial law . \\nhere is the irony . \\nif terrorists hit us today when we finally vote on this , let us suppose a few democrats do not make it over here . \\nyou are leaving this country vulnerable to change in power . \\nif the terrorists were to strike your conference retreat where the president speaks to the republican house and senate members and kill hundreds of house and senate members on the republican side , the democrats at that point claim the majority . \\nthe democrats at that point elect a speaker of the house . \\ni am a democrat , for goodness sakes ; but that is not the way to leave our country vulnerable . \\nyou are leaving your own party , you are leaving the will of the people through their elections vulnerable . \\nif we have temporary replacements , you immediately reconstitute the house ; you immediately ensure representation ; you assure that you maintain the balance of political power ; and you do it in an orderly , structured way with no chaos , in a way that is constitutionally valid by definition . \\nwhat you have proposed is not necessarily constitutionally valid . \\nit leaves the terrorists able to change our system of government . \\nit depends on a fantasy immediate or quick election . \\nit does not allow really qualified people necessarily to get here and act in time . \\nthere are so many things you have left undone . \\nyou are going to try to say that at the start of this year we have solved this problem ; let us go home . \\nyou have not solved the problem , and it is a doggone disgrace , and it is a danger to this country . \\nthe other day a gentleman testified before the committee on the budget and said this : `` the lack of preparation for continuity , for true continuity invites attack. '' you are inviting attack . \\nnot preventing attack . \\n\",\n",
       " 'mr. chairman , i rise to make two fundamental points before we proceed to vote on this . \\nthe two points are these : this resolution does not solve the real problem and it may create more problems than it purports to solve , and we have to understand that . \\nit does not solve the problem for this reason : by leaving us without a congress for 45 days , we essentially impose the opportunity for the executive branch to exert marshal law , and that is not what the framers of this country had in mind . \\nthis bill , if we do not provide some mechanism for prompt replacement other than this bill , will leave this country governed by an unelected executive , a cabinet member most likely who not a single american elected to that office . \\nfurthermore , it has a host of problems . \\nit does not address the possibility that one delegation will elect its representatives more promptly than another . \\nthey will come to this body , choose one of its members as speaker . \\nthat person could move on to become the president . \\nthen another delegation comes in , et cetera . \\nyou are essentially leaving this country without a house of representatives , without checks and balances , without separation of powers , for at least 45 days , assuming an election can be held in 45 days and assuming that the terrorists through an anthrax attack , like they subjected this very capitol to , will not somehow undermine that ability . \\nthis is reality . \\nwe have seen the reality here . \\nwe saw those airplanes hit the buildings , we saw the anthrax , and yet we are not truly acting to solve this . \\nmr. chairman , i yield to my distinguished friend , the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 . \\n',\n",
       " 'mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , let me make two final points : one , the majority party must understand this : if you are at a republican conference retreat and terrorists should strike you and kill the president and vice president and significant numbers of your side of the aisle , the democrats under your proposed law will obtain the majority , will elect a speaker of the house , and that person will then become the president of the united states of america . \\nyou are leaving this country vulnerable to that . \\nyou must not do it . \\nyou must not . \\nthis matter must be taken seriously . \\nit deserves full debate . \\nwhether it is the proposal of the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 and mine or others , we should commit to having this full house seriously consider this . \\nif we do not and we are not fortunate , history will not look kindly upon the jeopardy in which we have left this great nation . \\nvote no on this bill and insist on true debate on true continuity of congress in a responsible way that protects the balance of power , assures real succession to the presidency , and , most importantly , assures that your constituents will have representation at a time when our nation may well go to nuclear war , institute a draft , appropriate trillions of dollars , suspend habeas corpus and impose marshal law . \\nyou do not want that . \\nbut if you stop at this bill , you leave this nation vulnerable . \\nmr. chairman , if there is no one to speak in opposition , i ask unanimous consent to withdraw my preferential motion . \\n',\n",

issue to him . \\nhe joined the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 and me , along with former secretary of state candice miller and our distinguished colleagues , the gentleman from ohio ( mr. chabot ) xz4000710 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. paul ) xz4003110 , and the gentleman from maryland ( mr. bartlett ) xz4000170 , in co-sponsoring this legislation . \\nas a former secretary of state , the gentleman from oklahoma ( mr. cole ) xz4000770 understands how important this issue is for us to address . \\ni also want to express appreciation to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle . \\nin the last congress , while it has not happened in this congress , i was very pleased that the distinguished ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , joined as a cosponsor of this legislation , as well as my good friend and colleague , the gentleman from california ( mr. berman ) xz4000250 . \\nand it is my hope that we will be able to move ahead in a bipartisan way dealing with this very , very important institutional issue . \\nwe all remember september 11 of 2001 . \\nmy judgment has often been questioned because i was the last human being to walk out of this building on september 11 of 2001 , and probably correctly . \\ni did not think anyone would attack it . \\nand i will say that when i left the building on september 11 , 2001 , i did so when one of the great capitol hill policemen said to me that there was a plane headed towards this building , and we all know now that that is the plane that went down with those very courageous passengers in pennsylvania . \\nwhen we think back on september 11th , obviously it was one of the darkest days in the history of our republic , and it has led us to spend a great deal of time thinking about the unthinkable . \\nbecause of september 11th , we have had to ponder things that we would never even possibly consider because of the fact that we had not seen that kind of attack on u.s. soil . \\nbut since that time , the speaker of the house has really stepped up to the plate and done a wide range of things that are designed to ensure that the people 's house and , in fact , we hope both houses of congress , are able to continue to function . \\nif you recall on september 11th , late that afternoon , when members of both houses of congress , both political parties , stood on the east front of the capitol singing god bless america . \\nthe reason that members stood on the east front of the capitol was to let the american people and to let anyone know who would want to do us in , that we , as a nation , are strong , and this institution , the greatest deliberative body known to man , was continuing to function . \\nso beginning almost immediately after the attacks of september 11th , the speaker took a number of steps that were designed to maintain the continuity of this great institution . \\nhe established the ability to adjourn to an alternative place and to declare an emergency recess . \\nhe established the ability to effect a joint leadership recall from a period of adjournment through designees , and the requirement that the speaker submit to the clerk of the house a list of designees to act in the case of a vacancy in the office of the speaker . \\nand , mr. speaker , we all know that at the beginning of this 109th congress , we included in our opening day rules package the provisions that allow the house to establish a quorum , which could be lowered if we go through a litany of roll call votes that would determine that many members had been incapacitated and could not actually show up to work here . \\ni think it is important to note that we provided a number of protections in the use of that rule , including several that have been suggested by the members of the other side of the aisle . \\nand i have to add , mr. speaker , that the speaker of the house and the minority leader , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. pelosi ) xz4003140 , have personally engaged and spent time talking about this very important issue . \\nand it is my hope that we will , at the end of the day , end up with , as i said , a bipartisan compromise . \\nsome of those recommendations that came from members of the minority on this issue : extended roll calls lasting days at a time and excluding any time in recess so that members can contact the house and let us know that they can come to vote . \\nthe availability of the motion to adjourn at any time . \\nthe nonpartisan advice of the sergeant at arms , the capitol physician , and the medical and emergency personnel about the state of the membership of this body . \\nand , mr. speaker , at the recommendation of the minority , consultation with the minority leader , in accordance with the traditional relationship between the speaker and the minority leader . \\nand , finally , it is very important for us to remember that , as i just alluded to , that we have a bicameral legislature . \\nthe united states house of representatives does not operate unilaterally , so there will always be a check on any action taken under the mass incapacitation quorum provision . \\nwhat i have been discussing , mr. speaker , answers how we will do the people 's work if a terrorist attack incapacitates large numbers of us . \\nnow , the continuity in representation act of 2005 , which we are considering here today , deals with how we will replenish the house if terrorists kill large numbers of our members . \\nthis legislation calls for special elections to be held within 45 days following such a catastrophe . \\nthe gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001701 has just alluded to something , and while i know we do not enjoy the strong support of the minority on this , we have made a step in that we are going to have a manager 's amendment made in order that would allow us to move in the direction of what it is that the minority wants , and that is allowing for 49 days , which would be a full 7 weeks . \\nlet me say that this legislation addresses a number of very important matters and it incorporates a number of suggestions made , again by members on the other side of the aisle . \\nthey include more than doubling the amount of time for the special elections to occur from 21 days to 45 days . \\nand again we are going even further , to a full 7 weeks . \\nprotecting overseas military and absentee voters so that they receive additional time in which to return ballots . \\nand i want to thank , particularly , the distinguished ranking minority member of the committee on armed services , the gentleman from missouri ( mr. skelton ) xz4003770 , for his fine work in that area and his commitment to ensure that we address the issue of military and overseas voters . \\nprotecting civil and voter rights . \\nyou will recall when we considered this legislation , which at the end of the day drew large bipartisan support in the 108th congress , we were able to address the concerns that were raised by the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. watt ) xz4004240 at the end of the day when we were debating the legislation , and that is included in this . \\nagain , that is a recommendation that came from the minority . \\nwe allow states to have primaries and other options for selection of candidates for the special election so long as the general elections are completed within that period of time , which would be 49 days , excluding districts from the 49-day special election requirement if they already have either a general or special election scheduled , and including the four delegates and the resident commissioner of puerto rico within the provisions of the bill . \\nnow , i mentioned the large bipartisan support . \\nlast year , this legislation passed the house by a vote of 306 to 97 . \\ni believe that we need to continue working in a strong bipartisan manner to move this bill through the house and get it to the other body just as expeditiously as possible . \\nin that spirit , i anticipate that we will amend the rule , as i said , to move under this manager 's amendment from 45 to 49 days . \\nagain , our attempt to continue to work and address very , very correct concerns that are emerging from the minority . \\ni also have to say that on this rule itself we are very happy to have made in order the amendment of my colleague and neighbor , the very distinguished gentlewoman from california ( ms. millender-mcdonald ) xz4002750 , who has offered an amendment calling for 60 days . \\ni also want to congratulate her , mr. speaker , on her new assignment as the ranking minority member of the committee on administration . \\nshe is working closely with the gentleman from ohio ( mr. ney ) xz4002930 i know , and with the gentlewoman from michigan ( mrs. miller ) xz4002761 , who is going to be managing this legislation , and so we look forward to seeing what i hope is , again , a good bipartisan work product . \\ni want to talk now , if i can , mr. speaker , about how this bill protects what i feel is a very , very key part of our responsibility here : our representation . \\nwhen i was an undergraduate at claremont mckenna college , i had a professor who pounded the federalist papers into me . \\ni remember my mentor and the importance of the constitutional convention , and the great connecticut compromise of july 16 of 1787 . \\nand i remember that date because we convened the congress in philadelphia to mark the bicentennial of the connecticut compromise back on july 16 of 1987 . \\nof course , the federalists have been so important in explaining and justifying the actions of the framers as they put the constitution together . \\nwe all know that james madison was the father of our constitution , as well as having been president of the united states , he , as a matter of fact , was a member of the first committee on rules . \\nand a relative of mine served on that committee on rules at the founding . \\nmadison wrote extensively about this institution , the house of representatives in federalists 52 through 57 . \\nand one of the things i believe is very important for us to note is that madison talked about the absolutely critical importance of this institution being elected . \\nnow , mr. speaker , we all know that the 435 of us who serve as members of the house of representatives are the only federal officials who must be elected before we can serve . \\nin the other body , the united states senate , people are appointed by their governors if vacancies take place . \\nand we all know from the example of president ford , one can be appointed to serve as vice president and president of the united states without having been elected . \\nbut no one has ever served in the people 's house , this body , without having first been elected . \\nand i think it is important to note that madison made it clear when he was talking especially about this institution , as he said in federalist no . \\n53 , `` where elections end , tyranny begins. '' mr. speaker , as i said , we are the only federal office where no one has served here without having first been elected , and i think that is something we need to do everything we can to maintain . \\nin federalist 52 madison wrote : `` it is essential to liberty that the government in general should have a common interest with the people , so it is particularly essential that the branch of it under consideration should have an immediate dependence on and an intimate sympathy with the people . \\nfrequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectively secured. '' he went on in federalist 57 and wrote : `` who are to be the electors of the federal representatives ? \\nnot the rich more than the poor , not the learned more than the ignorant , not the haughty heirs of distinguished names more than the humble sons of obscurity and unpropitious fortune . \\nthe electors are to be the great body of the people of the united states. '' and , mr. speaker , madison rejected the idea that appointment of members is acceptable to the american public . \\nhe said , and i quote : `` the right of suffrage is certainly one of the fundamental articles of democratic government and ought not be regulated by the legislature . \\na gradual abridgement of this right has been the mode in which aristocracies have been built on the ruin of popular forms. '' i think it is very important for us to understand that there have been times in our nation 's history where we have faced greater difficulty than the difficulty that we face today , or even greater difficulty than we faced following september 11 of 2001 , and that was the civil war . \\nif we think back to that time of the civil war , we have to remember that this capitol was surrounded by troops who were threatening the very being of our republic . \\nyet president lincoln proceeded with elections , understanding how critically important they are for our republic 's survival . \\nand , of course , we have the newest example of self-determination in the world . \\nthe brave people of iraq recently tasted freedom and the joy of elections . \\nwhat happened ? \\nwe had many people saying those elections could not take place . \\nwhy ? \\nbecause there was a great deal of tension . \\nwe saw terrorist attacks , and we continue to see that in iraq . \\nbut we know that despite the bombs and the snipers and the fear of death , people exercised that very important right to self-determination . \\nhaving faced down aristocracy and tyranny , they knew just how important elections would be for them . \\nwe too are a democracy borne out of facing down aristocracy and tyranny ourselves , and we should never forget that for one moment . \\nmr. speaker , i am convinced that as we look at the struggles taking place in iraq today , that building and reinforcing democratic institutions is crucial for the safety , security , and happiness of a nation 's people , whether it is the people of iraq or the people of the united states of america . \\nthat is why when we looked at some of the other options to provide for our continuity as an institution , such as the stand-in appointments provision that the house overwhelmingly defeated last year , we should ask what we lose if we , for one moment , give up on elections . \\nsome have said that this is different ; that we will be dealing with a national emergency . \\nand i say that elections are particularly important during a time of a national emergency . \\nwe should not have stand-ins or successors from a list in our back pockets passing laws , declaring war , or suspending habeas corpus . \\ni believe that when we take this very , very unique institution , the people 's house , where no one has served without having first been elected , and move away from elections , that we threaten the very basis of our strength as a democratic nation . \\nthus as we look at the very tough challenge of how to preserve our democracy in the face of catastrophe , this legislation is the most responsible way to continue the legitimacy of our government . \\nif we look at the tragic loss of more than 100 members , the idea of having the states hold special elections in that period of time is something that is doable . \\npeople will unite and will remove all obstacles in conducting elections . \\nthink about it , mr. speaker . \\nin the time of a horrible tragedy , feeding and clothing one 's family , making sure the roof is over their head , and then playing a role in picking one 's leaders , that is all part of the process of rebuilding . \\nand it can be done in a relatively short period of time . \\nmy colleague ( ms. millender-mcdonald ) xz4002750 and i represent the state of california . \\na year and a half ago in our home state , we went through a special election -- recently , going through an unprecedented situation . \\nwe had the recall of a governor and an election that took place in 55 days . \\nit was not a single congressional district of 650 , 000 people with two or three candidates . \\nthat race had 135 candidates on the ballot , and they were running among a populace of 35 million people . \\nand i am happy to say that that election came off without a hitch . \\nand i should parenthetically say i am happy with the outcome as well , mr. speaker . \\nlet me close by saying that i think it is very important for us to realize again what james madison was telling us when he said `` when elections end , tyranny begins. '' we should do everything we possibly can to make sure that we keep this house 's very , very precious election process . \\nthis rule allows for consideration of measures that address that . \\nit is a very fair rule that again gives the ranking minority member an opportunity to have her proposal considered . \\ni do oppose that proposal because i believe that the notion of moving to 49 days will allow us to work this out very well . \\nand i again thank my colleagues , the gentleman from ohio ( mr. ney ) xz4002930 and the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 and others , who have worked long and hard on this . \\n\",\n",
       " \"mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished gentleman from california , the chairman of the committee on appropriations , for yielding me this time ; and i want to congratulate him on the fine work that he has done , not only on this legislation , but on all of the appropriations bills . \\nwe have debated this issue , mr. chairman . \\nwe debated this issue in the 108th congress . \\nwe have had three markups on this issue , two in the committee on house administration , one in the committee on the judiciary , and we had 122 democrats who joined with us in support of a responsible piece of legislation which , in fact , encourages the madisonian vision of an elected people 's house . \\nnow , i heard my friend from wisconsin talk about the fact that if we are going to pass this legislation , he would support it if we went ahead with a constitutional amendment . \\nit was the distinguished chairman of the committee on appropriations who just said we had that debate . \\nsixty-three members of this house chose to support a constitutional amendment . \\nthe only reason that we are here at this moment having this debate is that the other body has refused , last year and since march of this year , to proceed with acting on this house 's housekeeping matter . \\nit is a housekeeping matter for the house of representatives to maintain the process of elections . \\nnow , i think that if we look at the debate that we have had , if we look at the fact that we have continued since september 11 of 2001 to focus on a wide range of matters that impact this institution and the challenge that we never faced in our history , i believe that having this very important legislation that was passed by a margin of 329 in this congress , 329 to 68 , that including it now in the legislative appropriations bill is the most appropriate way to deal with it . \\nwe chose in the committee on rules to allow the gentleman from washington ( mr. baird ) xz4000110 to have an opportunity to strike this measure ; and in just a few minutes , we are going to , once again , have a vote on whether or not we allow the process of elections to go ahead . \\nnow , it is very true , it is very true that it would be difficult , it would be messy , it would be ugly ; but walter dellinger , the former solicitor general , a great constitutional scholar from duke university , made it very clear in his testimony before the committee on rules , when we talked about this issue , that he would prefer to see a house of representatives that is comprised of fewer members that are actually elected by the people than would be appointed . \\nnow , my friend from washington state talks about the fact that these appointed people would be running our country and we would not have elected people . \\nunder the constitutional amendment that my friend supports , we could see this institution , the people 's house , consist of individuals who are appointed making decisions over those who are elected ; and i think that is counter to the entire intention that was put forward by the framers of our constitution . \\nso when this comes up , i am going to urge a `` no '' vote on the baird amendment . \\n\",\n",

'' that bill has already passed the house twice , in slightly different forms , in the spring of 2004 and most recently on march 3 , 2005 . \\nthe senate refused to consider it the first time , and it is currently pending on the legislative calendar in the senate , where it will remain unless objections by various senators are dealt with . \\nmake no mistake : there are senators who strongly oppose this bill , and virtually none who care about it , or strongly support it , or want to take up the senate 's time with it . \\nthis means that , if the bill is to move at all , its supporters need to take the objections seriously , be prepared to negotiate , and avoid further antagonizing the opponents . \\nas ranking member of the committee of actual jurisdiction , the committee on house administration , i have never been consulted by the majority about beginning negotiations with the senate to try to resolve the objections and get a bill which can clear both chambers . \\nwhether such as effort could succeed is unclear , but -- nothing ventured , nothing gained . \\ninstead , the house appropriations committee has , to its obvious discomfort , effectively been hijacked by the house majority leadership to load the bill onto legislative branch appropriations in the belief that the senate will meekly submit to anything tucked into the house title . \\ni am not going to reargue the substantive issues here . \\nh.r. 841 was and is a bad bill . \\ni oppose it and voted against it . \\nwe should not be recycling failed legislation . \\nif the bill 's supporters ever hope to get it passed in some form , they need to make a serious effort to address the objections rather than to employ parliamentary games . \\nthey should not be misled by the margins by which the house has passed the bill . \\ncongress consists of two chambers . \\nunfortunately , some of the house sponsors appear to be treating a controversial and sensitive subject as if it were a perk of the house , as though the house alone somehow had acquired , contrary to the constitution and other federal laws , the right to control the procedure under which its members are elected . \\nthis position has gotten them nowhere . \\ni believe it is in fact counter-productive . \\nduring the appropriations markup , there were numerous questions about the continuity amendment which chairman lewis , who offered it , was unable to answer . \\nit was obvious that the committee had no idea what it was being asked to do and , based on the thunderous chorus of `` nays '' on the voice vote , was reluctant to be forced to do it . \\nmr. chairman , h.r. 841 is under the jurisdictions of the committee on house administration . \\nit has nothing to do with the appropriations process . \\nit has serious problems . \\nthe sponsors need to change their tune . \\nattempting an end run around the regular order on what is , despite their spin , a very controversial bill , does nothing to enhance credibility in potential negotiations with the senate . \\nif this bill is to be saved , let the members who care about and understand the issues engage seriously with those of differing views . \\nthat is how legislation becomes law . \\nnot this way . \\ni urge adoption of the baird amendment to strike title 3 . \",\n",

'' . \\nbecause the 45-day deadline for special state elections already places significant constraints on the electoral process and on the citizens represented due to its brevity , taking away the right to an appeal from the u.s. district court would excessively curtail the procedural due process rights enjoyed by citizens . \\ngiven that the time in which a federal judge has to compose an order disposing of these matters is provided in this bill , an equally expeditious appeals process should be provided so as to maintain consistency with the u.s. constitution and the commitment to both the 5th and 14th amendments . \\nthirdly , the amendment reads as follows : in section 26 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( b ) ( iv ) of the revised statutes of the united states , as proposed to be added by the bill , insert after `` vacant '' the following : `` any citizen of the district or any group of citizens of the state. '' . \\nthis proposal is very important to protect the interests of all citizens in the various congressional districts in the midst of party politics as well as the certification of classes in legal actions . \\nas the bill is drafted , section 2 , paragraph ( 4 ) , subparagraph ( iv ) would confer the right to sue in the event of a vacancy announcement by the speaker of the house solely to the `` executive authority , '' in the case of texas , the governor . \\nsuch overly restrictive language almost certainly threatens to deprive the citizens of a right that they should enjoy in the event that the governor chooses not to participate in a suit for declaratory or injunctive relief pursuant to a vacancy announcement made by the speaker of the house . \\nin order to protect the rights of every person who truly has an interest in a call for a special election under this act , this provision must be amended to allow citizens and classes of citizens to sue for relief . \\nmr. chairman , i ask that my colleagues support the voters of each state , the framework of the u.s. constitution , and the spirit of democracy by supporting the jackson-lee amendment . \\nmr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . \\n\",\n",
